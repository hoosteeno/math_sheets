# Math Practice!

math_sheets is a simple tool for creating basic arithmetic worksheets suitable for printing. 

## Why?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, with forced home schooling, I wanted an endless supply of basic arithmetic worksheets suitable for early elementary kids. [Searching for "math worksheets"](https://www.google.com/search?q=math+worksheets) revealed countless websites with a small number of static PDF worksheets. Finding, evaluating and printing them was annoying drudgery, and the output of that work was a hodgepodge of nonstandard, mixed-quality worksheets. Producing random numbers with an operator between them is not hard, so I decided to do it.

## Usage

Open the math_sheets site at https://hoosteeno.github.io/math_sheets/. Use the configuration section to set up the worksheet you want. Print it.

## Implementation notes

I never coded anything in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) before, so I decided to use it for this project. I also never used [CSS Grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) before, so I decided to use them in this project. The result is about 200 lines of code perfectly answering my need, but probably full of opportunities for improvement. 

## Contributing

I welcome pull requests making this project more capable. In particular...
* Screen media types could be substantially more attractive
* Division could be styled for long division
* The tool could include options for fractions or negative numbers
* A central grid element could have a random clipart in it
* Additional interfaces could address other similar homeschool needs
* Vue, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML could be more correct, more idiomatic, and I would enjoy learning how from your PR
